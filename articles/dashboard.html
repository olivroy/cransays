</h2>
<p>Your package will be stored in a different folder depending on its current state in the review process. The exact meaning of each folder is detailed in articles from the R Journal in <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018-1/cran.pdf" class="external-link">2018</a> and <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019-1/cran.pdf" class="external-link">2019</a>, and updated by a <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2019q1/003631.html" class="external-link">2019 mailing list post</a> (and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2022q2/008084.html" class="external-link">confirmed in 2022</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>inspect</strong>: your package is awaiting manual inspection by the CRAN team, probably because automated tests found a problem that is likely to be a false positive</li>
<li>
<strong>newbies</strong>: a specific queue for the manual inspection of first-time CRAN submissions.</li>
<li>
<strong>pending</strong>: a CRAN team member has to do a closer inspection and needs more time.</li>
<li>
<strong>human</strong>: your package has been assigned to a specific CRAN member (with initials as indicated by <code>subfolder</code>) for further inspection.</li>
<li>
<strong>waiting</strong>: the CRAN team is waiting for an answer from you, e.g. because issues are present that CRAN cannot automatically check for, such as maintainer changes (check your e-mail …)</li>
<li>
<strong>pretest</strong>: the CRAN maintainers restarted automated tests on your package to see whether an issue has been fixed by your action or is still present.</li>
<li>
<strong>archive</strong>: your package has been rejected from CRAN because it did not pass checks cleanly and the problems were not likely to be false positives.</li>
<li>
<strong>recheck</strong>: your package has passed basic checks. Because other CRAN packages depend on yours (“reverse dependencies”), a reverse-dependency-checking step is underway to see if your update has broken anything downstream.</li>
<li>
<strong>publish</strong>: you’re all set! Your package has passed the review process and will soon be available on CRAN.</li>
